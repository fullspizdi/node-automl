# node-automl

**Harness the power of Google's AutoML services directly within your Node.js applications.**

## Overview

node-automl simplifies the process of training and deploying high-quality machine learning models using Google Cloud's AutoML suite (AutoML Vision, AutoML Natural Language, and more). Eliminate the complexities of API interactions and focus on leveraging AI to solve your unique problems.

## Features

* **Intuitive Model Training:** Create custom image classification, object detection, text classification, and other machine learning models with minimal code.
* **Data Preparation Assistance:** Provides guidance and helpers for preparing your data in AutoML-compatible formats.
* **Deployment Integration:** Seamlessly deploy trained models for prediction in your Node.js applications.
* **Model Management:** Track and manage multiple models trained with AutoML.

## Installation

```bash
npm install node-automl
```

## Quick Start

```javascript
const automl = require('node-automl');

const myProjectId = 'your-google-cloud-project-id'; 
const datasetId = 'your-automl-dataset-id'

// Example: Train an AutoML Vision image classification model
automl.trainImageClassificationModel(myProjectId, datasetId)
  .then(model => {
    console.log('Model successfully trained:', model.id);
    // Use the model for predictions...
  })
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```
